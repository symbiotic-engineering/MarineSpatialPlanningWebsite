Wind energy, offshore aquaculture, and wave energy developers are entering an already crowded space in the ocean, with various groups vying for its bounty. Constructive engagement between new developers, coastal communities, and fisheries will become increasingly necessary in order to minimize conflict and increase production. Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a technique used to make informed decisions about the sustainable use of marine resources. Offshore developers have begun to use MSP in order to achieve these goals of minimized conflicts, increased production, and greater sustainability. In this website, an open-source MSP tool is developed to plan a favorable deployment location for a wave-powered aquaculture farm (WPAF) growing Atlantic salmon in the Northeast U.S. The MSP tool finds an optimal deployment location for the WPAF, while avoiding conflicts with existing or planned offshore activities, including recreational and commercial fisheries, military zones, offshore wind farms, shipping lanes, and marine protected areas.
