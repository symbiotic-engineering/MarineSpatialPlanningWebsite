# Website Design
This repository contains the website design for an interactive website for our Marine spatial planning (MSP) tool.
Visit the website at [this link](https://symbiotic-engineering.github.io/MarineSpatialPlanningWebsite/).

## File Structure
This repository consists of the following files:
- index: script to run main website file
- leaflet: scripts and function to produce this website using leaflet
- qgis2web: scripts and functions to import QGIS functions into the website

## How to use
The index.html file is the main file and the only one that needs to be run. Open and run the index.html file. It will call on the other files to be used.

## Context
The project is a part of the research in the Symbiotic Engineering Analysis (SEA) Lab.
Wind energy, offshore aquaculture, and wave energy developers are entering an already crowded space in the ocean, with various groups vying for its bounty. Constructive engagement between new developers, coastal communities, and fisheries will become increasingly necessary in order to minimize conflict and increase production. Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a technique used to make informed decisions about the sustainable use of marine resources. Offshore developers have begun to use MSP in order to achieve these goals of minimized conflicts, increased production, and greater sustainability. In this website, an open-source MSP tool is developed to plan a favorable deployment location for a wave-powered aquaculture farm (WPAF) growing Atlantic salmon in the Northeast U.S. The MSP tool finds an optimal deployment location for the WPAF, while avoiding conflicts with existing or planned offshore activities, including recreational and commercial fisheries, military zones, offshore wind farms, shipping lanes, and marine protected areas.
